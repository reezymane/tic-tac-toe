# tic-tac-toe

Let's play tic tac toe! This is a simple browser app that allows 2 users to play a game of tic tac toe.
This app's functionality is made by storing the user info into objects by using factories and storing the gameboard
and gameflow into separate modules. The purpose of this project is to make use of factories and modules to
have the lease amount of global code as possible in Javascript.
